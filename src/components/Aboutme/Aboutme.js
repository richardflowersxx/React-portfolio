Before entering bootcamp, I graduated highschool. I also have worked with stores mostly in customer service and Iâ€™ve learned skills to communicate and help customers. I also have learned the skill to work in teams to help give good customer service. I have succeeded in many challenges because I am able to brainstorm, be organized, and good at communicating ideas. With all the skill I have obtained so far, I see myself using my skills in the web developer or web designer workplace. </p>
